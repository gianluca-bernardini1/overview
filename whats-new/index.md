{: tip}

## Suspending and deprecating third-party software
{: #dep-susp-product}

New as of 05 October 2021

As a third-party provider, you can now suspend and deprecate published software from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog to meet the needs of your product's lifecycle. When you suspend a product or version, it is immediately removed from the catalog. When you deprecate a product or version, it remains available for use in the catalog for 90 days. After 90 days, it's permanently removed.

For more information, see [Deprecating software from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/docs/sell?topic=sell-deprecate-product) and [Suspending your product from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/docs/sell?topic=sell-suspend-product).

## Suspending and deprecating private products
{: #dep-susp-private-product}

New as of 05 October 2021

As a private catalog owner, you can now suspend or deprecate software that's in your private catalogs. When you suspend a version of software, it's immediately removed from your private catalog. When you deprecate software, it remains available to users with access to the private catalog for 90 days. After 90 days, it's permanently removed.

For more information, see [Deprecating a private product](/docs/account?topic=account-deprecate-product) and [Suspending a version of a private product](/docs/account?topic=account-suspend-product).

## Filtering the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by specific providers
{: #catalog-provider-filter}

New as of: 05 October 2021

The latest enhancements to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog include support for filtering products by provider name. If you're looking for a specific provider's products or curious about how many products that a provider offers, you can use the **Provider** filter to narrow down your search. To explore the filter updates, see the [catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog){: external}.

## Securing your resources with context-based restrictions
{: #cbr-resources}

New as of: 27 September 2021

You can now use context-based restrictions toÂ configure and enforce access restrictions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources. The access restrictions are based on the network location where an access request is created. These restrictions work in tandem with traditional IAM access policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions must enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials.

You can create context-based restrictions by defining one or more network zones, which contain allowed network locations, and then associating the zones with the cloud resource through a context-based restrictions rule. Network zones can be defined in terms of IP address constructs, VPCs, and service references, which grant access to a resource from another cloud service.

For more information, see [What are context-based restrictions?](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-context-restrictions-whatis)

## Assigning access policies based on resource location
{: #assign-location-access}

New as of: 24 September 2021

For supporting services, like {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}, you can now scope access to more granular locations in your access group policies, such as geography, country, metro, or a specific {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. For more information about assigning access based on location, see [Setting up access groups](/docs/account?topic=account-groups).

## Checking the root cause of an incident
{: #check-root-cause-incident}

New as of: 20 September 2021

For more information, see [Onboarding a Certified Operator bundle from a Red Hat registry](/docs/third-party?topic=third-party-bundle-register).

## New invitation flow for existing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} users
{: #new-invitation-flow}

New as of: 01 June 2021

To enhance security and user protection, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} now requires all users to accept an invitation in order to become an active user within a new account. The new invitation flow has an impact only on inviting existing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} users. Previously, existing users were being automatically onboarded to each new account as they were invited. After this change, these users need to accept an invitation in their notifications, by email, or by using the CLI to onboard to a new account.

To accept invitations in the CLI, existing members of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} must use the [**`ibmcloud login`**](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#accept-invitation-to-join-a-new-account-) command. They need to target the account that they are invited to join and use the new `--accept` flag.

## Term-based model for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support subscriptions
{: #support-subscriptions}

New as of: 23 September 2019

New subscriptions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support now follow the same term-based model as subscriptions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform services. Rather than credit being valid in monthly increments, credit is now available up front for an entire subscription term, which can be up to one year's worth of credit. You now have more flexibility to use your support credit when you need it, and the chances of incurring monthly overages are reduced. When you buy or renew a support subscription, any existing active support subscriptions are converted to this new flexible model for the remainder of their term. For more information, see [Support subscriptions](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#support-subscriptions).

You can also now view your support subscriptions in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console so you can keep track of your available credit. For more information, see [Viewing your support costs](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-support).

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprises for centrally managing multiple accounts
{: #ibm-cloud-enterprises}

New as of: 25 July 2019

You can now centrally manage billing and usage for multiple accounts by creating an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprise. With an enterprise, you can create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts by organizing related accounts into account groups. Enterprises simplify management of multiple accounts with the following key features:
   * Consolidated billing means that you can manage billing, invoicing, and payment for all accounts from a single place, the enterprise account.
   * Subscription credit is aggregated into a credit pool and shared with all accounts in the enterprise. Not only is tracking your subscriptions easier, but you can get fewer, larger subscriptions for a better discount because the credit is shared.
   * Top-down usage reporting gives you a unified view of usage costs from all accounts, organized according to your enterprise hierarchy.

If you have multiple accounts, at least one of which is a Subscription account, you can create an enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) and [Introducing IBM Cloud Enterprises](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/Introducing-IBM-Cloud-Enterprises){: external}  for more information.

## Subscriptions page for tracking subscription credit spending

You can now enable public access to objects in your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} buckets by using a new access group that is provided for you in your account. This new access group is called the `Public access` group, and all users and service IDs are added to it by default. You can update the policies for the access group to enable all users, even unauthenticated users, access to the resource that you specify in the policy. [Learn more about the public access group](/docs/account?topic=account-public#public).

## Multifactor authentication for users with federated IDs
New as of: 12 March 2019
{: #mfa-federated}

Account owners or users assigned the administrator role for the billing account management service can enable multifcator authentication (MFA) for all users in their account. Federated users who use their corporate or enterprise single sign-on ID can now be required to authenticate by using MFA for logging in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. For more information about this feature enhancement and what you need to know about enabling MFA for your account, see [Introducing MFA for IBM Cloud Users with Federated ID](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/introducing-mfa-for-ibm-cloud-users-with-federated-id){: external} .

## Unified login, API keys, and user and access management
New as of: 30 November 2018
{: #useraccess}

With our latest updates, you can take advantage of a simplified secure login that is available for all users regardless of your ID type. Whether you have an IBMid or a SoftLayer ID, you can quickly log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console from our enhanced login page. You can also make secure API calls across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and automate your CLI login by using an IAM API key or an IAM access token.

After you log in, you can now see all users, including platform and classic infrastructure users, from your Users page in the Access (IAM) UI. Depending on your access to view other users in the account, you can filter your view quickly by account users, classic infrastructure users, or Cloud Foundry org. You can also use the filters to find users quickly by name, email, or status.

Now that all of your users are in a single console, you can manage their access to all types of resources from the same place. Access starts with the user, so start by selecting a user from your list. Then, depending on which type of resource that you want to assign access to, you can choose from IAM access policies, Cloud Foundry access, or classic infrastructure permissions. If you want to assign IAM access policies, try creating an access group to streamline your access management process by adding all users to the same access group that need the same policies assigned.

If youâre familiar with our current global regions, youâll recognize names like US South and Sydney. Weâre aligning these location names to the names of the city in which the data centers physically exist.

For now, the programmatic IDs are not changing, so thereâs no impact from an API perspective. The following table shows the old and new location names. For more information and a comprehensive list of data centers and regions, see [Service availability](/docs/overview?topic=overview-services_region).

| Previous Location Display Name | New Location Display Name | Code     |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| US South                       | Dallas                    | us-south |
| US East                        | Washington DC             | us-east  |

## Assign account management access to others
New as of: 30 October 2018
{: #acct-mgmt-services}

With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can delegate common tasks that you complete as an account administrator to another user in your account. By creating an access policy on one or all of the available account management services, you can easily delegate responsibilities such as inviting and removing users, managing access groups, managing service IDs, maintaining private catalog services, and even monitoring billing and tracking usage. There are four individual account management services and an all services option that you can use to set up access policies:

* User Management for inviting and removing users
* IAM Access Groups for creating, editing, deleting, updating, and assigning access
* IAM Identity Service for viewing, creating, deleting, and assigning access to service IDs and associated API keys across the account
* Global resource catalog for viewing private catalog offerings and updating the metadata and visibility for the offerings
* All account management services for access to each of the individual account management service options based on the assigned role as well as access to billing and usage tracking.

For more information on the tasks that a user can do based on which account management service they have a policy on and which role they are assigned, see [Example platform management roles and actions for account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#account-management-actions-roles). For more information about this new feature, see the [Introducing More Flexibility and Control for IBM Cloud Account Management Services Access](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/introducing-more-flexibility-and-control-for-ibm-cloud-account-management-services-access){: external}  blog post.

## Searching for resources

## Dynamically add federated users to access groups
New as of: 12 July 2018
{: #add-fed-users}

You can create dynamic rules to automatically add federated users to access groups based on specific identity attributes. When your users log in with a federated ID, the data from the identity provider dynamically maps your users to an access group based on the rules that you set. For more information, see [Creating dynamic rules for access groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rules).

## Protect your service IDs and API keys
New as of: 1 June 2018
{: #protect-svcid-apikey}

To avoid a situation where your service ID or API key is deleted causing an outage or disruption, you can lock service IDs and API keys by using the UI or CLI. Locking a service ID also prevents any access policies from being changed, deleted, or assigned as well as any API keys associated with the service ID from being created or deleted. For more information, see [Locking a service ID](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys#lockkey) and [Locking an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey).

## Upgrade your Lite account to a Subscription account
New as of: 31 May 2018
{: #upgrade-lite}

You can now upgrade your Lite account to a Subscription account directly from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. With a Subscription account, you can use both platform and infrastructure offerings, and take advantage of discounted pricing by making a monthly spending and term commitment. You can also avoid surprises with fixed billing on a monthly payment schedule, but with the flexibility to order more or less based on your needs. For more information, see [FAQS for billing and usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-billusagefaqs).

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI rebranding
New as of: 15 May 2018
{: #cli-rebrand}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI commands changed from **`bluemix`** and **`bx`** to **`ibmcloud`**. However, you can still use the **`bluemix`** and **`bx`** CLI commands until they are removed later. There is no short name now, just the full name **`ibmcloud`**.

## Multi-factor authentication for your account
New as of: 02 May 2018
{: #account-mfa}

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring all users to provide a time-based one-time passcode in addition to their standard IBMid and password during login. This is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA). MFA is enabled per account, and once it is turned on, all users in the account are required to log in by using the extra security measure. For more information, see the [IBM Cloud Platform now adds support for Multi-Factor Authentication](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-platform-now-adds-support-multi-factor-authentication){: external}  blog post.

## Assign access quickly by using access groups
New as of: 03 April 2018
{: #access-groups}

Do you want to be able to assign access quickly by using the least number of policies possible? Now you can with access groups. Group a set of users and service IDs together and assign a single policy that applies to all members of the group. By using access groups, you can limit the time that you spend managing access to the users and service IDs in your account. Check out the blog post [New feature: Access groups](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/access-groups){: external}  for more details.

## Withdrawal of support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1
New as of: 28 November 2017
{: #nosupport-tls}

On 1 March 2018 {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} will withdraw support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 across many of our cloud products and services as part of our commitment to offering a cloud that is secure to the core and in alignment with industry best practices for security and data privacy.

## A new way to organize resources within your account
New as of: 16 November 2017
{: #usergs}

Resource groups are a new way for you to create customizable groupings of account resources, and access to the group and the resources within it are managed by using Identity and Access Management (IAM). Everyone starts out with a default resource group. You can rename this resource group and add new service instances to it as you create them from the catalog.

For users with a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can create extra resource groups to make managing quota and viewing billing usage for a set of resources easier. You can also group resources to make it easier for you to assign users access to more than one service at a time. To learn more about working with resource groups for your account, see [Managing resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs).

## Updates for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM
New as of: 16 November 2017
{: #iam-nov17}

The introduction of resource groups within your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account provides a new way for you to assign access. Users and service IDs can be assigned access to all services within a resource group, enabling you to quickly assign access to more than one resource at a time. You can also customize access for each user or service ID by assigning access to just some services within a resource group, or you choose to assign access to individual resources down to the service instance level. For more information about the features that you can take advantage of by using IAM, see [What features does IAM provide?](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview#features)

## Customize your dashboard view
New as of: 16 November 2017
{: #custom-dash}

You can view and manage all the resources in your account from your dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. And now, you can set filters to customize your view. For example, you can filter by resource group to view the specific resources in a resource group. You can also filter by region or Cloud Foundry space. For more details, see [Managing resources on the dashboard](/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview).

## Support Center
New as of: 2 November 2017
{: #support-nov17}

## Identity and Access Management application authentication feature
New as of: 6 October 2017
{: #app-authfeature}

Identity and Access Management (IAM) now supports service IDs, which you can think of as identities that can be used for apps to authenticate with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services. Instead of using individual user credentials, a Service ID can be created with an associated API key and access permissions in the form of a service policy that is assigned to the Service ID in order for you to control the level of access for any application authenticating with that ID.

For more information about the benefits of this feature and how to get started, see the [Introducing IBM Cloud IAM Service IDs and API Keys](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/introducing-ibm-cloud-iam-service-ids-api-keys){: external} .

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} global catalog
New as of: 27 July 2017
{: #gc}

Expanding on the last console update to manage your public regions from a single location in the console, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} now has a global catalog, making the process of selecting and deploying items that you select from the catalog a more streamlined process. Regardless of the region that you select in the console, you can now see all services that are available across all public regions from your catalog. Once you select a tile from the catalog, you can see which regions the service is available in, and select where you want to deploy it. For more information about the latest updates to the catalog, see [A global {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog makes building things easier](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/global-bluemix-catalog-makes-building-things-easier){: external} .

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console updates
New as of: 23 May 2017
{: #console-may17}

You can now manage your public regions from a single location through the updated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. The region selector offers you streamlined access to your resources, and other enhancements include higher availability and improved performance. For more information, check out [New Global Bluemix UI for Higher Availability and More](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/05/new-global-bluemix-ui-higher-availability/){: external} .

## Identity and access management
New as of: 01 May 2017
{: #iam-may17}

With the latest updates and improvements, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account owners or administrators can now use a new unified access control UI to take advantage of the following capabilities:
 * Manage users' fine-grained access to Kubernetes services and other services as they adopt the new access control features
 * Assign service policies and Cloud Foundry roles to users within their organizations

Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform users can create, delete, and list API keys associated with their user IDs. And platform users can use those API keys to authenticate when using APIs or CLIs.

Lastly, we enhanced our unified user management capability to ensure that in a linked IaaS-PaaS account, users are managed in a unified way with no need to add users separately in the SoftLayer Customer Portal or the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

For more information, check out the [Introducing Identity & Access Management](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/05/introducing-identity-access-management/){: external}  blog post.
