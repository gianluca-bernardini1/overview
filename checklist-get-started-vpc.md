# Getting started with Virtual Private Cloud checklist
{: #get-started-vpc-checklist}

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ![Checklist](images/checklist.svg) Understanding {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC | A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an enterprise establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure. A VPC gives an enterprise the ability to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.

| ![Checklist](images/checklist.svg) Understand the compute options available on VPC | **{{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}**: {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}} is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering that gives you access to all of the benefits of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC, including network isolation, security, and flexibility. With {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}} for VPC, you can quickly provision instances with high network performance. When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance. Instances are available on the x86 architecture. After you provision an instance, you control and manage those infrastructure resources. \n **{{site.data.keyword.bm_is_short}}**: You can provision dedicated, Bare Metal Servers for VPC on your own software-defined, private cloud and deploy to multizone regions. A bare metal server is ideal for expanding capacity of applications that benefit from elastic, quick provisioning, and deprovisioning. Accelerate deployment with preset server profiles for your high-performance workloads. You get the full suite of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC networking benefits, plus 4x faster networking throughput (up to 100 Gbps). Using a VPC for your dedicated, bare metal servers helps you isolate and provision network segments on the cloud, where you then can deploy and manage your compute, storage, and networking. \n **{{site.data.keyword.containerfull_notm}}**: {{site.data.keyword.containerfull_notm}} is a managed offering to create your own Kubernetes cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. As a certified Kubernetes provider, {{site.data.keyword.containerfull_notm}} provides intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management for your apps. Combined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud. \n **{{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}}**: {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} is a managed offering to create your own Red Hat OpenShift cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} provides intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management for your apps. Combined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud. \n Review the Cloud Native section for **{{site.data.keyword.containerfull_notm}}** and **{{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}}** for checklists on deploying these two options.  |
